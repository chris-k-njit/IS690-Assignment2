## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

16. **What is Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and how is it implemented in your project?**

RBAC ensures that there are different roles within a project, which is necessary to ensure that certain user roles have more privileges than others. 
- Typically within a project and the associated database, user roles are only granted information or access on a need-to-know basis. 
- End user roles would typically have the least permissions, as they would only need access to accomplish the simple or basic tasks they expect within a project.
- Higher level user roles would usually be assigned to high level end users, who need more access to some of the lower level roles.
- The highest level roles would usually be reserved for developers, programmers who need to be able to access and adjust everything within an application.
- In summary, RBAC ensures that private/privileged/sensitive information is aligned with the correct user roles and not accessible to just any user role.

For this project, there are the following roles that can be found:
- **ADMIN**
- **ANONYMOUS**
- **AUTHENTICATED**
- **MANAGER**

Of the roles listed above, only those who have a **ADMIN** or **MANAGER** level role are able fully engage in User Management (as was noted on the localhost/docs).
