## JWT and User Authentication

9. **Detail the steps involved in the user email verification process. Provide a pseudo-code workflow from sending a verification email to activating the user's account.**

Similar to Questions 2 and 8, this question follows a similar path:
    1) Head to your browser of choice and get to localhost:8000/docs , this will provide a detailed look into the API for your application.
    2) Scroll down to the **Login and Registration** area in order to verify the email for a user via a GET method.
    3) Expand the /verify_email/{user_id}/{token} so that you can now verify a user.
    4) Find the button with a grey outline at the top right of the container that is labelled, "Try it out". Click this button first.
    5) After completing step 4, now click on the big blue button labelled "Execute" under the Response Body section.

I saw that the code to verify the email was in the : [user_routes.py](../app/routers/user_routes.py)
- Noting that the verify_email_wtih_token is the function we see will be what we are looking for.

Within the [user_service.py](../app/services/user_service.py) , I saw within the function listed above the code here to prove if a user email has been verified based on their role.
