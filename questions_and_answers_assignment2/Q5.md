## Pytest

5. **Why is Pytest critical for the development of the API?**
- Pytest is extremely critical/crucial for API development, as Pytest assists us in writing and executing the tests needed to ensure that endpoints within an API (as well as business logic) are working as anticipated.
- Pytest provides support for:
    - Parameterized testing
    - Has a massive, robust plugin ecosystem (e.g., pytest-cov, pytest-sugar, pytest-tldr, etc.)
