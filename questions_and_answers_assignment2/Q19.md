## Route Parameters and Pydantic Schemas

19. **Explain how route parameters are used in FastAPI. Provide an example of a route that takes a parameter and demonstrate how it is used within the endpoint.**

In FastAPI, route parameters are part of the URL and are also utilized for capturing dynamic values that are generated. In this project, that would usually take into account a request made from the end user (as a dynamic value) and then passing this through to get the correct response for the end user (based off of that original dynamic value).

I found an example of a route that takes in a parameter and demonstrates how this is used within the endpoit in the [event_routes.py](../app/routers/event_routes.py)

Here we can see that the even_id is parameter that the route has taken, which then will get moved/passed through to the delete function/method of the EventService class.

Upon successful deletion, this event will be fully purged from the database.

```python
@router.delete("/events/{event_id}", status_code=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT, name="delete_event", tags=["Event Management Requires (Admin or Manager Roles)"])
async def delete_event(event_id: UUID, db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db), token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme), current_user: dict = Depends(require_role(["ADMIN", "MANAGER"]))):
    success = await EventService.delete(db, event_id)
    if not success:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND, detail="Event not found")
    return Response(status_code=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)
```
