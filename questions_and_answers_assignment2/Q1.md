## FastAPI and Pydantic

1. **What role does Pydantic play in FastAPI, and how does it enhance data validation and settings management?**
   - Within FastAPI, Pydantic is utilized for: Data Validation & Settings Management.
   - Essentially, data that is received through requests/responses will adhere to the schema specified within an application using FastAPI and Pydantic.
   - When all things are correctly implemented, this can help to make code more robust (thanks to type checking/validation that's done automatically).
   - Additionally, Pydantic provides easier configuration management as settings are controlled through environment variables (i.e., like ones used on GitHub Actions).

Provide examples from the project where Pydantic is used.
   - From the schemas directory, within app directory:
      - [event_schema.py](../app/schemas/event_schema.py)
      - [token_schema.py](../app/schemas/token_schema.py)
      - [user_schemas.py](../app/schemas/user_schemas.py)

   - From the services directory, within the app directory:
      - [user_service.py](../app/services/user_service.py)

There are more examples than these here, I included these to provide a general overview of examples where Pydantic is used.
