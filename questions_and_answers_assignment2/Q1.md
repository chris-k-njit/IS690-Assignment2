## FastAPI and Pydantic

1. **What role does Pydantic play in FastAPI, and how does it enhance data validation and settings management?**
   - Within FastAPI, Pydantic is utilized for: Data Validation & Settings Management.
   - Essentially, data that is received through requests/responses will adhere to the schema specified within an application using FastAPI and Pydantic.
   - When all things are correctly implemented, this can help to make code more robust (thanks to type checking/validation that's done automatically).
   - Additionally, Pydantic provides easier configuration management as settings are controlled through environment variables (i.e., like ones used on GitHub Actions).

   - Provide examples from the project where Pydantic is used. (Code provided below shortly.)
