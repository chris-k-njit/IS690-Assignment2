## API Design and Implementation

15. **What is HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)? Provide an example of its implementation in your project's API responses, along with a screenshot.**

- HATEOAS is a constraint associated with REST APIs, which typically let end users/clients navigate resources via links.

- These links contain hypermedia that are dynamically generated, based on what is done by the end user.

- Essentially, the end user will interact with an API which will then work with the server and provide whatever resource/information/service/action that was requested from the end user.

This can be observed within the code provided here from [user_routes.py](../app/routers/user_routes.py) :
```python
async def get_user(
    user_id: UUID, 
    request: Request, 
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db), 
    token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme), 
    current_user: dict = Depends(require_role(["ADMIN", "MANAGER"]))):
    try:
        user = await UserService.get_by_id(db, user_id)
        return UserResponse.model_construct(
            id=user.id,
            nickname=user.nickname,
            first_name=user.first_name,
            last_name=user.last_name,
            bio=user.bio,
            profile_picture_url=user.profile_picture_url,
            github_profile_url=user.github_profile_url,
            linkedin_profile_url=user.linkedin_profile_url,
            role=user.role,
            email=user.email,
            last_login_at=user.last_login_at,
            created_at=user.created_at,
            updated_at=user.updated_at,
            links=create_user_links(user.id, request)  # Hypermedia links are created here, based off of the user id and the request that a user made.
        )
```
