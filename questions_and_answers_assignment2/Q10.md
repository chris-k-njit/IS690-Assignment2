## Security Practices

10. **How do you ensure the security of user passwords in your project? Discuss the hashing algorithm used and any additional security measures implemented.**

- One way to ensure that user passwords remaining secure in a project is to use password hashing.
- In this case, the bcrypt hashing algorithm is used in this application.
- As far as I know, once a password has been hashed it cannot be "unhashed". In the case of any database breaches, the passwords of users should still remain protected (though it would be highly recommended that users change their password once database services were fully restored/fixed).
- On the [/user_service.py](../app/services/user_service.py) , we can see that hashed password being use on line 51 of this file.
