## Database Management with Alembic and SQLAlchemy

4. **How does Alembic manage database migrations, and why is this important for maintaining database schemas?**

- Alembic helps to manage database migrations as it allows admin (or higher level uers with database priveleges) to create, update, and save/apply changes that were made to a database schema as time goes on. 
- Essentially, this helps to keep the schema of the database in perfect sync with the application code.
- If we aren't able to maintain this, things would be problematic if our application and database are not correctly configured to work together.

   - Illustrate with an example of a migration script from the project. Below is a sample of what was executed in the terminal and output following it.
   ```shell
   (venv) username@computername: ~/directoryname$ docker compose exec fastapi alembic upgrade head
   INFO [alembic.runtime.migration] Context impl PostgresqlImpl.
   INFO [alembic.runtime.migration] Will assume transactional DDL.
   INFO [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade  -> 6b62f34b7189, initial migration
   ```
