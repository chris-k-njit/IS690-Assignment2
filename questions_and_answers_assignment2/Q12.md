## Project Management with Docker and CI/CD

12. **Discuss the advantages of using Docker Compose for running your project. How does it help in maintaining a consistent development and deployment environment?**

Here are some of the advantages of using Docker Compose for a project/application:
- Docker Compose provides containerization for your app/project, making it incredibly simple to streamline your app/project for cloud deployments.
- Projects/apps will with Docker Compose ensures that no matter the OS or other variables that aren't accounted for, users should now have a similar experience when running these apps.  Scalability can be better accounted for by changing the configuration in the future.
- Docker Compose makes it so development and deployment will be the same for those working on the same project/app when using Docker Compose. With this one command, it makes it very easy ti start up the entire application stack.
- Assuming the YAML configuration files are correctly configured, this ensures that dependencies and configurations are accounted for from the start. This ensures a consisten environment for all developers and their CI/CD pipelines.

Sample YAML below, to demonstrate how developers would maintain a consistent work environment:
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - .:/code
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres:12
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: mydatabase
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
volumes:
  pgdata:
```
