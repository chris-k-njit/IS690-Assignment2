## Project Management with Docker and CI/CD

13. **Describe the role of GitHub Actions in your project's CI/CD pipeline. How do you automate testing and deployment using GitHub Actions?**

- GitHub Actions helps to ensure that any application/project/s CI/CD pipeline is testing and deploying automatically (rather than being done manually).
- To be less vague, the automated testing here in this project helps to run pytest and other python based tests, to ensure the code of the project is working as anticipated. If something goes awry, this should get caught by the GitHub Actions and force a developer to resolve the issue.
- A developer will be able to trigger this automated testing with either a 'push' or a 'pull' to the main branch of the repository on GitHub.
- Once all testing works and there are no issues here, the image of the project is created and then deployed to the DockerHub repo that was assigned to it (via Environment secrets on GitHub).
- To confirm the success of the automated testing and deployment, a user would be able to see that the repo had a change recently made to it on their repo on Docker.

Below is some YAML code to demonstrate what was mentioned above:
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    services:
      db:
        image: postgres:12
        env:
          POSTGRES_USER: user
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
          POSTGRES_DB: mydatabase
        ports:
          - 5432:5432

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: 3.9

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest
```
