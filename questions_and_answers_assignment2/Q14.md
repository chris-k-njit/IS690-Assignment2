## API Design and Implementation

14. **What are REST APIs, and how do they function in your project? Provide an example of a REST endpoint from your user management system.**

- REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs utilize HTTP requests in order to perform CRUD operations within an application.
- Standard HTTP methods are used with REST, as they are stateless.

The best code to demonstrate this can be found in [user_routes.py](../app/routers/user_routes.py), in the get_user function that was used in an answer for a previous question.
