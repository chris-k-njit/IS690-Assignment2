3. **Explain the service repository pattern and how it is applied in your project. Provide an example of how routes are managed and linked to services.**

- As far as I understand at this point, the service repository pattern is what helps distinguish or separate the data access logic from the business logic.
- This is ideal for developers/programmers/etc. as it helps us to better maintain a codebase and making the code cleaner in the process.
- Repositories are used to handle the database interactions, while services are what help handle the business rules put forth.

Below are some examples of how routes are managed and linked to services:
- Getting the user ID from user routes [user_routes.py](../app/routers/user_routes.py)
```python
async def get_user(
    user_id: UUID, 
    request: Request, 
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db), 
    token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme), 
    current_user: dict = Depends(require_role(["ADMIN", "MANAGER"]))):
    try:
        user = await UserService.get_by_id(db, user_id) # Specifically, THIS LINE
        return UserResponse.model_construct(
            id=user.id,
            nickname=user.nickname,
            first_name=user.first_name,
            last_name=user.last_name,
            bio=user.bio,
            profile_picture_url=user.profile_picture_url,
            github_profile_url=user.github_profile_url,
            linkedin_profile_url=user.linkedin_profile_url,
            role=user.role,
            email=user.email,
            last_login_at=user.last_login_at,
            created_at=user.created_at,
            updated_at=user.updated_at,
            links=create_user_links(user.id, request)  
        )
    except UserNotFoundException as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND, detail=str(e))

```
Getting the User ID within the user service [user_service.py](../app/services/user_service.py)
```python
class UserService(DbService):

    @classmethod
    async def _fetch_user(cls, session: AsyncSession, **filters) -> Optional[User]:
        query = select(User).filter_by(**filters)
        result = await cls._execute_query(session, query)
        return result.scalars().first() if result else None
    
    @classmethod
    async def get_by_id(cls, session: AsyncSession, user_id: UUID) -> User:
        user = await cls._fetch_user(session, id=user_id)
        if not user:
            raise UserNotFoundException(f"User with ID {user_id} not found.")
        return user
```
