## JWT and User Authentication

7. **Decode the following JWT and explain its contents:**
   - Token: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJqb2huLmRvZUBleGFtcGxlLmNvbSIsInJvbGUiOiJBRE1JTiIsInVzZXJfaWQiOiJjZGY4M2QzZi0zNzQ5LTRjZGQtOTRlYS1hNTVjZmMwNDhkMGYiLCJleHAiOjE3MTc2MTY4MjAuMjIwNzA5fQ.ANS8PgUiwPCmOvnZLYTCy_5WzLyhCDOx8aF4xu-Kaz8`
   - Use [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) to decode and explain the contents.

After navigating to [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) to decode the token, these were my results:

**Header**
```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```
- "alg" indicates that the HS256 algorithm was used here in the header.
- "typ" indicates that this is a JWT.

**Payload**
```json
{
  "sub": "john.doe@example.com",
  "role": "ADMIN",
  "user_id": "cdf83d3f-3749-4cdd-94ea-a55cfc048d0f",
  "exp": 1717616820.220709
}
```
- "sub" shows the subject of the token (in this case, the user, john.doe)
- "role" shows what level role this subject has (in this case, an ADMIN level role)
- "user_id" shows the id of the subject that is unique to every user
- "exp" shows the time when the token will expire.
