## Security Practices

11. **Explain the difference between hashing and encoding. Provide examples from your project where each is used:**
    - **Hashing:** Example and explanation with code
    - **Encoding:** Example and explanation with code

**Hashing:** 
- The process of transforming data inputs into a string of characters at a fixed-size.
- Typically a digest (output of a hash function) which CANNOT be reversed.

- An example of hashing is seen here: [user_service.py](../app/services/user_service.py) , we can see that hashed password being use on line 51 of this file.

**Encoding:**
- The process of converting data into a different format, with a method/function that is available publicly (rather than being a private method).
- Usually encoding is used to ensure that the data here is able to be used/consumed by numerous systems that may differ from each other.

- An example of encoding is seen here: [user_routes.py](../app/routers/user_routes.py), where we can see this from lines 207  of the create_access_token where this is best demonstrated.
